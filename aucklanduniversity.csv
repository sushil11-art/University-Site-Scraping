<p>The degree is made up of 480 points, studied in four parts (Parts I–IV). It is a combination of compulsory law courses, elective law courses, non-law courses from another degree programme and one General Education course. We offer a wide range of law elective courses, including Corporate and Commercial, Public, Criminal, International, Family, and Environmental Law.</p>

<p>Unlike other undergraduate degrees, the LLB does not have a major attached to it. Everyone who earns an LLB degree gains a broad background in the law.</p>

<p>After completing the LLB, students who wish to be admitted as a barrister and solicitor must complete an approved professional legal studies course.</p>
